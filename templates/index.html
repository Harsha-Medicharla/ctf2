        <h1>Sherlock Holmes: The Mystery of the Midnight Cipher</h1>

        <p>It was a stormy night, and the streets of London were shrouded in a thick fog. At 221B Baker Street, Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson sat by the fire, examining a peculiar letter that had arrived earlier that evening.</p>
        <!-- “The user is none other than the master of deduction—Sherlock himself.” -->
        <p>“This, Watson, is no ordinary correspondence,” said Holmes, holding the parchment up to the light. “Its sender has gone to great lengths to obscure its meaning. Notice the smudges here—they suggest the use of invisible ink, activated by heat.”</p>

        <p>Watson leaned forward, intrigued. “And the message itself? What does it say?”</p>

        <p>Holmes smiled faintly. “It’s a cipher, my dear friend. The words appear random, but they hide a deeper truth. Listen to this:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            'In the chimes of midnight lies the key, <br>
            Seek the numbers, one, two, and three. <br>
            Combine their sum with the letter’s plea.'
        </blockquote>
        <div class="hidden">
            <p>323231422d534833524c4f434b</p>
        </div>
        <p>“Clearly, the sender wishes to test our intellect,” Holmes remarked. “But the answer lies not in the obvious interpretation. We must think laterally, consider every detail, and above all, trust in logic.”</p>
       

        <p>Hours passed as the two men worked tirelessly, deciphering clues hidden in plain sight. Holmes finally stood, his eyes alight with understanding. “Watson, I have it! The cipher points us to a hidden safe, concealed behind a portrait at the Royal Opera House.”</p>

        <p>But the challenge wasn’t over yet. Holmes turned to you, dear reader, with a knowing smile. “You must now solve the next step. Within the source of this very page lies the key to your journey. Use your sharpest wit to uncover it.”</p>
        <!-- "Watson, the key lies in the source—a sequence encoded in Base-16. Unravel it to uncover the truth." -->

        <div class="hint">
            <p>“Remember,” Holmes added, “great detectives never overlook the smallest detail. Check the hidden depths where secrets often reside.”</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</body>


    <!-- "Ah, the path to the next chapter in your investigation! 
     This, my dear Watson, is but the entrance to a concealed 
     domain—an enigma waiting to be unraveled. Add '/problem'
      to the end of your journey, and within, you shall find the clue 
      that leads to your next great discovery." -->
