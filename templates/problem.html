        <h1>Sherlock’s Journey</h1>
        <p>On a stormy night in London, Sherlock Holmes decided to take a long and grueling journey to solve a mysterious case that had been troubling Scotland Yard. Each day, he would walk a certain number of miles in a specific pattern to clear his mind and gather clues.</p>

        <p>On the first day, Sherlock would walk <b>a</b> miles, on the second day, he would walk <b>b</b> miles, and on the third day, he would walk <b>c</b> miles. From there on, his walking pattern would repeat, with Sherlock walking <b>a</b> miles on the fourth day, <b>b</b> miles on the fifth, <b>c</b> miles on the sixth, and so on.</p>

        <p>Sherlock will complete his journey when he has walked at least <b>n</b> miles in total. Your task is to determine the exact day on which Sherlock will complete his journey.</p>

        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>You are given four integers <b>n</b>, <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, and <b>c</b>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>n</b> is the total distance Sherlock wants to cover in kilometers.</li>
            <li><b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, and <b>c</b> represent the number of miles Sherlock walks on the first, second, and third days respectively.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Your task is to determine the exact day Sherlock will have walked at least <b>n</b> kilometers in total, completing his journey.</p>

        <h2>Input</h2>
        <p>The first line contains one integer <b>t</b> (<b>1 ≤ t ≤ 1000</b>) — the number of test cases.</p>
        <p>For each test case:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The first line contains an integer <b>n</b> (<b>1 ≤ n ≤ 10⁹</b>) — the total distance Sherlock wants to walk.</li>
            <li>The second line contains three integers <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, and <b>c</b> (<b>1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10⁶</b>) — the distances Sherlock walks on the first, second, and third days, respectively.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Output</h3>
    <p>For each test case, output one integer — the day on which Sherlock will have walked at least <b>n</b> kilometers in total, completing his journey.</p>

    <h3>Test Case </h3>
    <pre>
    Input:
    4
    12 1 5 3
    6 6 7 4
    16 3 4 1

    Output:
    5
    1
    6
    </pre>

    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Test Case 1: Over the first four days, Sherlock walks 1+5+3+1 = 10 kilometers. On the fifth day, he walks another 5 kilometers, making his total distance 15 kilometers. Since 12 kilometers are needed, Sherlock will complete his journey on the fifth day.</li>
        <li>Test Case 2: In the second test case, Sherlock will walk 6 kilometers on the first day, which is exactly n=6, completing the journey on the first day.</li>
        <li>Test Case 3: Sherlock will walk 3+4+1=8 kilometers in the first cycle. Then the next 8 kilometers after repeating the cycle completes on the 6th day, with the total 16 kilometers.</li>
    </ul>
